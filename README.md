The website can be viewed [here](https://tgc-proj4-app.herokuapp.com/). Use the dummy staff account to gain access to the [Manage Product page](https://tgc-proj4-app.herokuapp.com/manage_product/) as a staff to manage data in the database. Use the dummy customer account to use the website as a regular customer.

## Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project
Build a full-stack website that allows user to manage a common dataset, which includes allowing users to share their own data with the community and having access to data by others. Main technologies used should include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask & Mongodb.

For the practice of my django and full-stack coding skills, I have decided to do a different spin on the official [Cavaliers Team Shop](https://www.cavaliersteamshop.com/) and setup a typical e-commerce website with basic functionalities such as presentation of products in database, manipulating data(e.g. user delivery address, cart items), making transactions online and keeping a order transaction history.

## Strategy
### Problem
The Cleveland Cavaliers sports team requires a platform to earn revenue by selling merchandises for fans like apparels & accessories. On the other hand, fans can gain access to the platform and purchase these products to show love and support for their favorite team.

### Proposed Solution
Create an e-commerce mobile-friendly website that can be accessed by fans to buy the fan goods they want.

### External Users' Goals
1. Fans will purchase fan goods to show support & love for their favorite team.

### Site Owner's Goals
1. Sell team merchandise to gain revenue, set up promotions and marketing. 
2. Allow fans to stay connected through social media links.
3. Provide excellent customer experience so that customers will visit the website again.

## Scope
